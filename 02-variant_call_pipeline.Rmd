## Summary

\

In this activity we process mitochondrial DNA FASTA sequences from self-declared white Brazilian individuals, downloaded from the GenBank. We process the FASTA sequences and then align them to the hg19 UCSC reference genome. The end results are VCF files that we need to do further processing to feed machine learning algorithms that will use the mitochondrial genetic variants to classify the individuals into their haplorgroups.

\

## 1. Process FASTA sequence

\

The mitochondrial sequences contained spaces in between as well as were lower case. In the first day of writing this notebook, I was not able to run those raw FASTA sequences into the first step of the variant call pipeline: alignment with BWA. This is one example of a fasta sequence that I started with:

\

```{bash, eval=F}
>AF243780
tattgactca cccatcaaca accgctatgt atttcgtaca ttactgccag ccaccatgaa
tattgtacgg taccataaat acttgaccac ctgtagtaca taaaaaccca atccacatca
aaaccccctc cccatgctta caagcaagta cagcaatcaa ccctcaacta tcacacatca
actgcaactc caaagccacc cctcacccac taggatacca acaaacctac ccacccttaa
cagcacatag tacataaagc catttaccgt acatagcaca ttacagtcaa atcccttctc
gt
```

\

To fix the sequences formatting, I searched for Bash commands to remove spaces and make the letters uppercase. These were satisfying solutions I came up with:

\

```{bash, eval=F}
cd ~/Desktop
string='tattgactca cccatcaaca accgctatgt atttcgtaca ttactgccag ccaccatgaa
tattgtacgg taccataaat acttgaccac ctgtagtaca taaaaaccca atccacatca
aaaccccctc cccatgctta caagcaagta cagcaatcaa ccctcaacta tcacacatca
actgcaactc caaagccacc cctcacccac taggatacca acaaacctac ccacccttaa
cagcacatag tacataaagc catttaccgt acatagcaca ttacagtcaa atcccttctc
gt'
## Remove spaces
trimmed_string=$(echo $string | tr -d ' ')
## Make uppercase
echo  $trimmed_string| tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' > AF243780.fasta
## Print to the first line
awk 'BEGIN { print ">AF243780" } { print }' AF243780.fasta > temp && mv temp AF243780.fasta
```

Reference for the AWK command:

\

### Multiple fasta with capital letters and spaces removed

\

Finally, this chunk allows us to transform the mitochondrial FASTA files downloaded from the GenBank using R. The paths are from my local machine but I transfer the capital fasta file to the appropriate folder in the hummingbird server:

\

```{bash, eval=F}
## Change directory to the folder in my local machine, where I stored the GenBank mitochondrial sequences.
cd ../geraldo/data/
## Open file, remove spaces and make letters uppercase
cat mt_brazilian.fasta | tr -d ' ' |  tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' > mt_brazilian_capital.fasta
```

\

### Split and rename each fasta file

\

```{bash, eval=F}
## Change directory to the fasta folder
cd /hb/home/gchaves/results/geraldo/mitochondria/fasta
## splitfasta breaks multi-fasta file
/hb/home/gchaves/.local/bin/splitfasta mt_brazilian_capital.fasta 
## Change directory to the folder containing all fasta files
cd mt_brazilian_capital_split_files
## for loop
for file in mt_brazilian_capital_*; do 
  echo $file; 
  ## create variable fileName using the first line of fasta and removing the '>'
  fileName=$(head -n 1 $file | sed 's/>//g')
  ## change the splitfasta name to the header name
  mv $file $fileName".fasta"
  echo "this is the new file now:" $fileName".fasta"
  ## move the file to the directory above.
  mv $fileName".fasta" ../
done
## After everything is done, change directory to the directory above
cd ..
## Remove the filder that splitfasta created.
rm -r mt_brazilian_capital_split_files
```

\

## 2. UCSC Hummingbird Server Script

\

### 2.1. Index the fasta file with bwa

\

Example of alignment with bwa. In the references folder, run:

```{bash Example of alignment with bwa, eval=F}
bwa index -a bwtsw AF243627.fasta
```

\

Example of output:

```{bash example of result, eval=F}
(base) dcuser@ip-172-31-90-246:~/variant_call/references$ bwa index -a bwtsw AF243627.fasta
[bwa_index] Pack FASTA... 0.00 sec
[bwa_index] Construct BWT for the packed sequence...
[BWTIncCreate] textLength=604, availableWord=65536
[bwt_gen] Finished constructing BWT in 2 iterations.
[bwa_index] 0.00 seconds elapse.
[bwa_index] Update BWT... 0.00 sec
[bwa_index] Pack forward-only FASTA... 0.00 sec
[bwa_index] Construct SA from BWT and Occ... 0.00 sec
[main] Version: 0.7.17-r1188
[main] CMD: bwa index -a bwtsw AF243627.fasta
[main] Real time: 0.029 sec; CPU: 0.005 sec
(base) dcuser@ip-172-31-90-246:~/variant_call/references$ pwd
/home/dcuser/variant_call/references
(base) dcuser@ip-172-31-90-246:~/variant_call/references$ ls
```

\

#### Align reads to the index (perform for each experiment):

\

To move to the sam folder, run:

```{bash change directory to sam, eval=F}
cd ../sam/
```

\

Check what exists in the sam folder:

```{bash check the sam folder, eval=F}
ls ../sam/
```

\

In the sam folder, align the fasta file:

```{bash run indexing, eval =F}
bwa mem -t 4 ../references/AF243627.fasta ../fasta/AF243628.fasta	> AF243628.sam
```

\

Now check what exists in the sam folder:

```{bash check what exists in the sam folder, eval =F}
ls ../sam/
```

\


There should be a result similar to this now, indicating that we have a sam (sequence alignment/map) file in the sam folder:

\


```{bash There should be a result similar to this now:, eval =F, background = 'red'}
(base) dcuser@ip-172-31-90-246:~/variant_call/sam$ ls ../sam/
AF243628.sam
```


\

This variant call pipeline was recorded on document Lin2016/pipeline_192. In the second day of writing this notebook, I decided to run the multi-fasta file in the BWA alignment step. In the humminbird server, I store the mt_brazilian_capital.fasta in the ~/results/geraldo/mitochondria/fasta folder to run the variant call in the Scrip in Part 2: Hummingbird Script. I deleted mt_brazilian_capital.fasta in geraldo/data in my local machine because I did not want the mt_brazilian_capital.fasta to be uploaded to GitHub when publishing the geraldo website.

In this chunk I will reuse the for loop from above to run the variant call for all fasta files.

\

#### Chunk of server

done

echo "Finished entire for loop"

echo "$((duration / 60)) minutes and $((duration % 60)) seconds elapsed."
```

\

### Chunk of practice

\

In this part we assume to be inside the fasta folder.

\

```{bash, Chunk of practice, eval=F, include=T}
echo "This is the task in the for loop"
REFERENCE=../references/AF243627.fasta
```

\

* In this part we change directory to the fasta folder using the absolute path on purpose

* We must make sure with 100% probability that we are changing the directory to the correct fasta folder

* That is the reason why we must start with the *absolute path* to the fasta folder:

\

```{bash, Chunk of practice reference FASTA file, eval=F, include=T}
cd /home/dcuser/variant_call_gepoliano/fasta
```

\

### 2.2. Variant Call Pipeline using a for loop strategy

\

* Then we execute the Variant Call Pipeline Using a for loop Strategy:

\

```{bash, Variant Call Pipeline using a for loop strategy:, eval=F, include=T}

cd /home/dcuser/variant_call_gepoliano/fasta

## for loop specific to the individual fasta files
for fastaFile in AF*.fasta; do
  
  ## Pick just the eight firt letters of the string
  fastaFileName=${fastaFile:0:8}
  echo "started sample $fastaFileName"
  
  ## Align
  bwa mem -t 4 $REFERENCE $fastaFile > ../sam/$fastaFileName".sam"
  echo "Just finished aligning sample $fastaFileName"
  
  ## SAM to BAM
  samtools view -S -b ../sam/$fastaFileName".sam" > \
  ../bam/$fastaFileName".bam"
  echo "Finished SAM to BAM of sample $fastaFileName"
  
  ## Samtools uses reference FASTA to detect "piles" in the alignment
  bcftools mpileup -f $REFERENCE ../bam/$fastaFileName".bam" > \
  ../bcf/$fastaFileName".bcf"
  
  ## Bcftools extracts SNPs
  echo "started Bcftools SNPs for sample $fastaFileName"
  bcftools view -v snps ../bcf/$fastaFileName".bcf" > ../snps_vcf/$fastaFileName"_snps.vcf"

done

echo "Finished the entire for loop"

```

### Fix the bcftools error 

\

After a couple hours dealing with this error:

Failed to read from /hb/home/gchaves/results/geraldo/mitochondria/bcf/AF243782.bcf: unknown file type

I noticed this part in the error message:

\

```{bash, eval = F}
Note that using "samtools mpileup" to generate BCF or VCF files has been
removed.  To output these formats, please use "bcftools mpileup" instead.
```

\

I then replaced the line in the code above, to 

\

```{bash, eval = F}
bcftools mpileup -f ~/references/hg19/GRCh37.p13.genome.fa ~/results/geraldo/mitochondria/bam/AF243780.bam  >   ~/results/geraldo/mitochondria/bcf/AF243780.bcf
```
